								<p style="color:grey">A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
								<p>A security architects’ role is to manage the building and maintenance of an organisation’s technological security in general whether it’s taking up a risk advisory role, ethical hacking or pen-testing. This is a role I am currently interested in pursuing due to its wide variety of different security tasks to complete instead of focusing upon a singular and specific role whilst also being able to socialise and work closely within a group and working with new clients often allowing me to meet new people
								<p style="color:grey">A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
								<p>A security architect Is a role that requires comprehensive knowledge of a broad spectrum of skills that are in cybersecurity such as knowing current threats and how to prevent them, experience in pen-testing, experience in ethical hacking and experience in building security architecture in smaller projects. Security architects must also be able to work well with groups and be able to perform analysis on the current security systems of organisations and presenting findings to others in an easy-to-understand manner. Additionally, knowledge of coding is a must have in the field.
								<p style="color:grey">A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
								<p>Currently the skills and experiences I hold that attribute to the progression of achieving my goals come from my VCE Software Development subject which have given me some basic understanding of the threats posed to organisations (such as MITM attacks) and ways to prevent malicious attackers which is a key skill needed for a security architect. I regularly work in groups and have had previous experience being in a leadership position in both sports and school.
								<p style="color:grey">A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position,
									building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly
									over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can
								<p>My plan to become a security architect Is to first complete my degree in IT and major in cybersecurity, additionally I intend to undertake certifications in my 3rd year of my degree such as Network + and Security +. I also hope to get an Internship with Deloitte in either their Cyber-risk advisory or security consulting. Once completing my internship, I hope to work within the company in the respective division I interned in. Whilst working and garnering experience I intend to further my education by pursuing a CISSP certification and possibly a masters in cybersecurity. This process will obviously take some time and require a lot of time and effort, but hopefully will all be enough to become a security architect and then eventually hopefully start my own security firm.
