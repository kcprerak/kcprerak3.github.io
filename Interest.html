								<p style="color:grey">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
									Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
								<p>My specific interest in IT is currently in Cybersecurity and how to make the future technological world a more safer place to traverse and in particular more so in banking transactions. My interest within the IT field sprung from taking software development for my VCE subject, I found the topics and programming to be enjoyable and interesting especially when discussing threats and ways to protect from possible threats. Through my VCE subject I was able to learn the 		 	 fundamental ideas of some IT concepts and programming concepts, additionally the subject also taught me how to use Visual Basic
								<p style="color:grey">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
								<p>I chose RMIT for itâ€™s practical application of ideas rather than relying heavily on theoretical studies RMIT offers hands on experience in topics that I find interesting especially within STEM. I also chose RMIT for its location within the city, although it does take some time to get to campus I find the city and the campus a fun place to learn and explore
								<p style="color:grey">What do you expect to learn during your studies?
								<p>I expect to learn key concepts of IT and programming that are pivotal in having a successful career and future after I finish my studies and in particular I hope to study Cybersecurity and ways to protect peoples Data and privacy from malicous intent
