								<p style="color:grey">What do the results of these tests mean for you?
								<p>The results in particular test 2 and 3 help me to understand what type of person I am given the specific questions that I answered. Test 2 shows me that I more of a visual learner and would thus benefit in a study style that accommodates such learning. Furthermore test 3 displays specific character details of myself such as my ‘cheerfulness’ or my ‘gregariousness’  and shows areas of my character that I could possibly change to become a better version of myself.
								<p style="color:grey">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
								<p>All 3 tests demonstrate a general level of outgoingness and extraversion which would mean I would be outgoing and sociable within the group and would have regular conversations with groupmates whether it would be about the project or any other topic that piques interest. The 1st test also states that I am spontaneous in nature.
								<p style="color:grey">How should you take this into account when forming a team?
								<p>When considering who should be in a group with me when looking at the test then it would be logical to have a group with people who similarly are highly outgoing and sociable as more ideas and discussions within the group can be explored without someone being left out as pairing a group full of more outgoing people will mean that regular conversation would be held thus ideas will be able to flow between every group member
